            <p>My name is Adam Skoczylas and I am a front-end developer. I write web applications in Ember.js and React. I have over eight years of experience working on client facing apps. The projects I have worked on include conference registration forms, e-commerce websites, robo-advisor app, and meeting app for managers. I speak HTML, CSS, JS, RWD, and currently improving my TS.</p>
            <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy making pour-over coffee, listening to vinyl records, and reading American postmodern fiction. I am also an avid biker.</p>
